Crystal collector game

In this game you will be given a random number and four different crystal images with random numbers assigned to them.
The goal of the game is to click on each image of the crystal to get the value to equal the random number shown on screen.
When you win it adds to the win value and when you lose it adds to the lose counter and then resets.
This game is great.
